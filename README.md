### GPG Commmand's Try

This is a repository containing the commands that I've
tried within `gpg`. The files are named accordingly.
The main message used here is `Hi` & the I've piped
the output of echo into the command. Here is the syntax
the repository files follow:
`echo "Hi" | gpg <command> >> command.txt`

This is just a trial and error repository & I hope to
learn more about GPG with this. You're free to verify the
signatures of the files etc.
